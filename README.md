I created this site during my 2nd Semester as Project Cov'19... When I was just exploring about WEB.
Project Cov'19 was basically a Software Engineering Project in which we were tasked to create SRS (Software Requirements Specification), Activity Diagrams, 
UCDs (Use Case Descriptions), Context Diagrams, and much more!
